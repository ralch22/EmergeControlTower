How to Build the Content Factory Agent in 7 Days
(The exact agent that replaces 2–3 full-time writers + designers and produces 40–60 finished, client-ready pieces per day)
This is the #1 highest-ROI agent in every 2026 pod. Build this first — it pays for the entire unlimited stack on day one.
Final Output of the Agent (example day for one client)

8 LinkedIn posts (carousel + text + image)
4 Twitter/X threads
2 blog posts (1,200–1,800 words each, Surfer-optimized)
12 Google/FB ad copies (3 headlines + 3 descriptions each)
1 short video script + voiceover + auto-edited video
1 weekly newsletter
→ All perfectly on-brand, zero human writing from scratch.
